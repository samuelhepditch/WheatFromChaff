## My Writing Process

Prompt:

I want to learn <concept>. I need to learn it from first principles. I am writing for this prestigious blog:


Wheat From Chaff is a place on the web where I work through complex ideas in an effort to better understand the world. My goal with every post is to start from first principles and reason upward toward higher level concepts.

My hope is that after reading a post, readers can explain the subject matter clearly without relying on memorization. As the famous Physicist Richard Feynman explains in this video, learning vocabulary to explain other vocabulary creates the illusion of knowledge without real insight. What matters is the ability to explain ideas simply by tracing them back to their foundations, and then we can rebuild them in a way what actually makes sense.

If you want to learn about computer science, entrepreneurship, finance, and the art of living you are in the right place.

How can I learn this <concept> and explain in through one or many blog posts. Where should I start, how should I build up to this <concept>. Be granular on explaining what posts should come first.


## Your Editorial Rule (Non-Negotiable)

For every post, ask:

If this idea didn’t exist, what would break?
If you can’t answer that in one paragraph, the post isn’t ready.
